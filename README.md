# AML2UML

Initial aim of this project is to make an utility that read the Aras Innovator DataModel and translate it into an UML graph.

For a faster development we just translated it into XMI which is the XML for UML. It's XMI 1.1 which means that most of the newest commercial software can't import it (they request XMI 2.0 at least). But we use StarUML to import it and then generate Class Diagrams.
